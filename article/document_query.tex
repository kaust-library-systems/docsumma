\section{Introduction}
In this work we describe a system to help the appraisal of documents by creating a summary of each document.

The summary is generated using a local Large Language Model (LLM) called ``Ollama.'' Local because the model runs on the local computer without the need of any network access. This is important to the privacy data since it's not upload to a cloud provider.
